These scripts are our fort-in-a-box toolkit.

Getting started
===============

If you want to try to build a core.fort-style box, you have two options:

- Use [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) to build a VM to test/develop the contents of this repository. (The VM will almost certainly run out of disk space.)
- Run the commands in the `Vagrantfile`'s script on a machine you want to fortify (in a local copy of this repository).

Todo

- Move `wanted` to cookbooks
